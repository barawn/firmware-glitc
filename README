Firmware for the GLITC FPGA on the TISCs in the ANITA-3 design.

This firmware now uses Vivado, which means you need to sadly set things up
a bit more. After checking out the project, you need to run

build-project.bat

under Windows to actually create the project.

Might be able to automate this eventually, but right now, sadly no can do.
