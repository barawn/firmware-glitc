Firmware for the GLITC FPGA on the TISCs in the ANITA-3 design.

NOTE:

Due to a bug in Place where it mistakenly believes that the LVDS pairs
are backwards, it is necessary to set XIL_PAR_ALLOW_LVDS_LOC_OVERRIDE to 1
in order to compile the firmware at this point.

This can either be done as an environment variable before launching ISE,
or it can also be done inside ISE at the Tcl Console with the command

set env(XIL_PAR_ALLOW_LVDS_LOC_OVERRIDE) 1
